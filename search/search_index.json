Getting Started with a New Project: Clone a Git repository You can use a Git repository URL to start a new project. The repository will be cloned to the selected location and then opened into Monokle Desktop. This allows multiple colleagues to debug, validate, and diff all of your configuration files taking full advantage of all of the features of Monokle Desktop to achieve your desired state while also maintaining clear control of your version changes. Branch Selector In the header, next to the Project Selector, a dropdown menu appears whenever Monokle Desktop detects the current project has a Git repository. With the Branch Selector, you can search through all of your local and remote branches in more detail while having the option of creating new local branches. Git Panel In the left menu of Monokle Desktop, there is a dedicated Git panel. This panel contains the Changelist which is grouped into two lists: Staged and Unstaged files. By clicking on each file, you will immediately see the differences between the old version and the newer, modified version with valuable insight as you work to achieve your desired state. Using the checkboxes, select multiple files to apply the same action at once. After staging some of the files, you can commit the changes directly via Monokle Desktop.

Monokle Desktop can preview resources generated by Helm, helping you debug your charts before you deploy them to your cluster. This requires Helm to be installed and configured in your PATH. All examples below are from the Emissary Ingress Charts Folder - clone and try these yourself! Configuring Helm Integration In Settings, set which Helm command to use when generating Helm previews in Monokle Desktop: Helm Preview Configurations Each Helm chart has a subsection named Preview Configurations . This allows you to configure how to run the Helm Preview and then save the configuration in order to quickly use it at any time. Hovering over the Preview Configurations section will show a Plus button to the right: Clicking on the button will open a Drawer to the right: This form allows you to: - Name your configuration. - Choose and order which values files to be used for the preview. - Choose between using the helm template or helm install commands. - And, optionally, provide options for the command. See more about the options in Helm\u2019s documentation: https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/. Finally, you can save your configuration for later use or save it and start previewing the resources right away. Saved Preview Configurations will show up in the subsection of the Helm chart it was created for: By hovering over the configuration you will see the Preview, Edit and Delete actions. If you instead click and select the configuration, the source code editor from the right will be replaced with the Helm Command Pane, which will display the generated command that will be run by Monokle Desktop to create the preview: Helm Navigation When selecting a folder containing Helm charts (identified by Chart.yaml files), these will automatically be displayed in a \"Helm Charts\" section on top of the Navigator: In the screenshot: The Helm Charts section shows the \"emissary-ingress\" Helm chart and the contained values files. The single values.yaml file has been selected. The corresponding values.yaml file has been highlighted to the left. The content of the file is shown in the Source editor on the right of the screen. The Navigator at this point shows any K8s resources that Monokle Desktop finds in the selected folder. Helm Preview The Helm Preview functionality helps you understand what resources would be installed in your cluster when running Helm with a specific values file. Hovering over a values file reveals a Preview action to the right: Selecting this action will run Helm on the selected file with either the install or template option (as configured in the global settings) and replace the contents of the Navigator with the generated resources. For example, previewing the values file above will result in the following: Monokle Desktop is now in Preview Mode (as indicated by the header at the top): The File Explorer has been disabled. The Navigator now contains all resources generated by running Helm with the selected values file. Resource navigation works as with files; selecting a resource shows its content in the source editor in read-only mode. Resource links are shown as before with corresponding popups/links/etc. Selecting Preview for a different values file will switch the preview to the output of Helm for that file. Selecting Exit in the top right or next to the values file restores the previous resource navigator. Editing of Values Files If you're editing Helm Values files, Monokle Desktop will highlight all properties that have been referenced by any templates. The list of paths to template files is shown when hovering over the highlighted value. When previewing a Helm values file, it is possible to edit the previewed file and recreate the preview, allowing you to quickly assess the impact of any changes on the generated files, instead of having to exit and recreate the preview to make a change. Working with Helm Templates Each Helm Chart from the Helm pane has a subsection which displays all templates of that chart. Clicking on a template will select it and open it in the Editor. When you hover over a value referenced from a Values file, the popup that appears will display the following information: - The path to the values file where the reference is from. - The referenced value, so you don't have to switch to the Values file. - A link to quickly navigate to the location of that value.

How can you register a CRD? There are 2 ways: Load the objects from a Cluster. Monokle Desktop will scan the resources and, if it finds a CRD, it will register it so it can later recognize the Custom Resources. Use the CRDs Schema panel from the Validation tab.

The linked argo-rollouts-metrics Deployment (via the selector in the Service manifest) is highlighted. The Service manifest is shown in the Editor to the right (with highlighting of the link to the Deployment on line 16). Resource Links Links between resources are indicated by link icons to the left and right each resource name: Links to the left indicate there are incoming links to the resource. For example, a ConfigMap might have an incoming link from a Deployment. Links to the right indicate there are outgoing links from the resource. For example, a Service might have a selector that selects a Deployment. Hovering over a link icon will show a popup with all links (either incoming or outgoing) allowing you to click on a link to take you to that resource in the navigator. In the following image, the popup shows the outgoing link from the argo-rollouts Service to the argo-rollouts Deployment (via the selector in the Service manifest). If a link is \"unfulfilled\", i.e., not referring to any object currently in the navigator, it is marked with a warning triangle, making it easy to identify broken resource links in your manifests: In this screenshot the rollouts-demo-root RoleBinding contains a reference to an rollouts-demo Role, which doesn't exist in the current manifests. Clicking on broken links will open the corresponding reference in the editor so you can easily fix it. Resource Filtering Resource filters allow you to filter the resources based on various properties such as: Name Kind Namespace Labels Annotations Click on the filter button on the top of the navigator to launch the dialog for configuration.

A Monokle Desktop Template is a mechanism for creating visual forms and interpolating the data from those forms into one or multiple manifests. For each form, we must define the JSON schema of the data to use as an input and a UI-schema for customizing the visuals of the forms (for example, specifying which widgets should be used). Monokle Desktop uses the React-Schema-Form component to render template forms for the provided schemas, read more in their documentation on how to further work with forms, schemas and ui-schemas. Any folder that contains a monokle-template.json file can be a template. What is the structure of monokle-template.json for a valid Monokle Desktop Template?

All types of templates have these properties. In the above example, the type of the template is \"vanilla\" . What does a form schema look like? The format of form schemas is JSON schema . This defines which data that will be sent to the template manifests. { \"type\" : \"object\" , \"required\" : [ \"name\" , \"image\" ], \"properties\" : { \"name\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" , \"default\" : \"my-pod\" }, \"namespace\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" }, \"image\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" } } } What does a form UI schema look like? Example: { \"name\" : { \"ui:title\" : \"Name\" , \"ui:help\" : \"The name of the Pod\" }, \"namespace\" : { \"ui:title\" : \"Namespace\" , \"ui:help\" : \"The target namespace for the Pod\" , \"ui:widget\" : \"namespaceSelection\" }, \"image\" : { \"ui:title\" : \"Image\" , \"ui:help\" : \"The image name to use for the Pod, for example nginx-ingress:latest\" } } The role of this form is to specify information about how to render the form - read more about ui-schemas in the UI-Schema Documentation Custom Form Widgets Monokle Desktop provides a number of custom form widgets to provide a better user experience: namespaceSelection : Shows a dropdown with all namespaces in the current set of resources. imageSelection : Shows a dropdown with all the images found in the current set of resources. apiGroupSelection : Shows a dropdown with all apiGroups known by Monokle Desktop. podSelectSelection : Shows a dropdown with all labels assigned to any pods or pod-specs in the current set of resources. resourceSelection : Shows a dropdown with resource names from the current set of resources. This can be narrowed down by adding a ui:options.resourceKinds property containing a |-separated string of desired resourceKinds. For example: { \"targetClusterRole\" : { \"ui:title\" : \"Target ClusterRole\" , \"ui:help\" : \"The ClusterRole to bind to the created ServiceAccount\" , \"ui:widget\" : \"resourceSelection\" , \"ui:options\" : { \"resourceKinds\" : \"ClusterRole\" } } } All these widgets allow entry of custom values - i.e. none require you to select a known value. Property Interpolation Monokle Desktop uses [[ and ]] as escape delimiters for script interpolation. For the JSON Schema example above example, if this form is the first one in the forms array from monokle-template.json , then we will be able to use the values in the template manifests: propertyOne : [[ forms [ 0 ] .name ]] propertyTwo : [[ forms [ 0 ] .namespace ]] otherProperty : [[ forms [ 0 ] .image ]] Scripts are run in a sandboxed environment giving you access to built-in Javascript objects. For example the following is taken from the basic-role-template which will create a YAML array of selected verbs in the corresponding form. verbs : - [[ forms [ 0 ] .verbs.join(\"\\n - \") ]] What types of templates exist? Monokle Desktop has vanilla templates and referenced Helm Chart templates. Vanilla Templates The type property from monokle-template.json is \"vanilla\". In vanilla templates, we must provide the manifests that will be generated as an output. For example, here is a simple template manifest example: deployment.yaml apiVersion : apps/v1 metadata : kind : Deployment name : [[ forms [ 0 ] .name ]] The [[forms[0].name]] parameter will be interpolated based on the input received from the form. In this specific example, the value of the name property from the first form will be inserted. Using the manifests property from the monokle-template file, specify the above template manifest like this: { \"manifests\" : [ { \"filePath\" : \"deployment.yaml\" } ] } Referenced Helm Chart Templates The value of the type property from monokle-template.json is \"helm-chart\" . Example of monokle-template.json : { \"name\" : \"Minecraft Server (Test Plugin)\" , \"id\" : \"com.github.devcatalin.monokle-test-plugin.minecraft\" , \"author\" : \"Catalin\" , \"version\" : \"1.0.1\" , \"description\" : \"Create your own Minecraft server\" , \"type\" : \"helm-chart\" , \"forms\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Minecraft Server\" , \"description\" : \"Default settings for your Minecraft Server\" , \"schema\" : \"form-schema.json\" , \"uiSchema\" : \"form-ui-schema.json\" } ], \"valuesFilePath\" : \"values.yaml\" , \"chartName\" : \"minecraft\" , \"chartVersion\" : \"3.6.1\" , \"chartRepo\" : \"https://itzg.github.io/minecraft-server-charts/\" , \"helpUrl\" : \"https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/minecraft-server-charts/minecraft\" } In this example, we can see the first part of the file looks similar to the vanilla templates. However, for Helm chart templates we do not specify a manifests array, we specify information about the chart. The properties chartName , chartVersion , chartRepo are required to identify the helm chart. This type of template must bundle a values.yaml file that can contain properties that will be interpolated with values from the forms. For example, we could have the following values.yaml in the template folder: values.yaml version : [[ forms [ 0 ] .version ]] maxPlayers : [[ forms [ 0 ] .maxPlayers ]] In the monokle-template.json example from above, we notice a valuesFilePath that specifies the path to the values file. This file will be interpolated with values from the forms and used by Helm to generate the output resources. How do I install a Template? Templates can be installed via Plugins. Read the How to install a Plugin section from Plugins Overview . Note: A plugin can contain one or multiple templates. Default Monokle Desktop Templates Monokle Desktop includes a default set of templates which are installed automatically when starting Monokle Desktop for the first time and available in the Templates Explorer when working with your Monokle Desktop projects.

Launch Monokle Note: Please follow this Getting Started guide to install Monokle \ud83d\ude80 Launch Monokle and, on the welcome screen, there are three options to start working with projects: Select an exisiting folder. Create an empty project. Start from a template. Click Select an existing project to add your project folder containing K8 resources. Select Folder Select your folder to parse its manifest in the file explorer. In the file explorer, you can view manifests, including their resources and their relationships. Select Manifests Scroll up and down to navigate and select the required manifests. Once you select a manifest, its related resources will be highlighted automatically in the navigator. Create a New Resource Click on the Add button (plus sign) in the Navigator to launch the Create Resource dialog for creating resources. At the bottom of the dialog, you can select the option to: - Save to folder. - Add to file. - Don't save. Use the Source Editor Step 1: Navigate and select the resource in the Navigator. Once you select a resource, its source code will be launched automatically in the Source Editor. The Source Editor allows you to view and edit the source code easily. Step 2: Right click anywhere in the Source Editor to launch the menu to select the required editing option from the drop-down list. You can also edit the source code using the Form Editor, which does not require any coding effort. Using the Form Editor The Form Editor collects the required information and passes it to another entity. To launch the ConfigMap Editor, click on the Form button. For Configuration Data Step 1: Click on the Add Item button to create a new text field for data configuration. Step 2: Enter the text configuration data in key-value pair fields. Note: You can also edit the existing data in the key-value pair fields. For Binary Configuration Data Step 1: Click on the Add Item button to create a new binary data field for binary data configuration. Step 2: Enter the binary configuration data in key-value pair fields. Note: You can also edit the existing binary configuration data in the fields. Step 3: Tick the Immutable checkbox to ensure the data stored in the ConfigMap is not updated. Using the Object Metadata Editor To launch the Metadata Editor, click on the Metadata button. For editing object metadata, you need to provide a specific name, namespace, annotations, labels, cluster name, generate name, and finalizers to uniquely identify the object. Name Step 1: Enter the specific key name in the name field to give a unique identity to the object. Note: The name of the ConfigMap must be unique within a namespace. Namespace Step 1: Enter namespace in the namespace field to organize clusters into virtual sub-clusters. Note: Provide a unique namespace within the ConfigMap. If left empty, the default namespace value shall be assigned automatically. Annotations Step 1: Click on the Add Item button to create the new key-value field for annotations. Step 2: Enter the arbitrary metadata in key-value pair fields. Note: You can also edit the existing arbitrary metadata data in the fields. Labels Step 1: Click on the Add Item button to create the new key-value field for labels. Step 2: Enter the label's details in the key-value pair field. Note: You also can edit existing label data in the fields. Cluster Name Enter the name of the cluster in the Cluster Name field to which the object belongs. Generate Name Enter a prefix in the Generate Name field. Note: You can also edit the existing data in the Generate Name field. Finalizers Step 1: Click on the Add Item button to create the new finalizer field. Step 2: Enter the finalizer in the finalizers field. Note: You also can edit the existing data in the finalizer fields. Kubernetes is prompted to wait until specific conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion. Note: Finalizer must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. The source editor provides autocomplete and autosave options to automatically save your edits. Questions or Comments?
